## 🌌 About Me
I am a **Tech Enthusiast** and **Software Developer** with a passion for out-of-the-box ideas and a critical view on the mainstream. Here you'll find a blend of innovation, sharp irony, and futuristic code.

## 🚀 My Galactic Tech Arena

### **Programming Paradise**
- **Languages:** Golang, Java, Python, Bash, Lua, JavaScript *(because why not?)*
- **Frameworks:** No thanks – outdated trends are over.
- **Mobile Development:** Android, iOS, Windows Phone
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL – because even data deserves personality.
- **AI:** I know how to make an prompt a guess – AI, Lero style.

### **System Administration & DevOps in the 22nd Century**
- **Operating Systems:** Debian, Ubuntu, (Windows, if necessary)
- **Containers & Virtualization:** Docker, Kubernetes – so code is actually working on your tesk too.
- **CI/CD & Automation:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins – because nothing builds itself.

- **Networking & Security:** Cloudflare, Nginx, WireGuard
